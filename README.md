### ES6 featured Boilerplate for Meteor/React application.

This is a simple application build upon React, Meteor 1.3 (Beta preview with ES6 features) and Twitter Bootstrap 4.0.0 (Alpha preview).

What's the difference? The 1.3 release of Meteor is comming soon, and it will be the game changer. It comes with ES2015 modules support and direct access to NPM modules.

The following example shows how to easily build simple application using NPM modules on both client and server.

##### Used Meteor packages:

 * [flow-router](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router/): carefully designed client side router for Meteor.
 * [bootstrap](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/): the most popular front-end framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.
 * [fontawesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/): scalable vector icons that can instantly be customized.

##### Used NPM packages
 * [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) and [react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom): a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
 * [react-mounter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-mounter): lets you mount React components to DOM easily.
 * [react-komposer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-komposer): compose React containers and feed data into components.

#### Running the example

The application requires Meteor.

```
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

After installing Meteor simply clone the repository and execute `meteor`.

```
git clone https://github.com/schabluk/none.git
cd none
meteor
```

#### Application Modules

##### Main (client/components/main.jsx)

```javascript
import React from 'react'

const Main = () => (
  <div className="row">
    <div className="col-sm-12">Hello there!</div>
  </div>
)

export default Main
```

##### Layout (client/layouts/default.jsx)

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import Header from './header.jsx'
import Footer from './footer.jsx'

const Layout = ({content}) => (
  <div>
    <Header />
    <div className="container">{content}</div>
    <Footer />
  </div>
)

export default Layout
```

##### Routing (client/routes.jsx)

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import {mount} from 'react-mounter'
import Layout from './layouts/default.jsx'
import Main from './components/main.jsx'

FlowRouter.route("/", {
  name: "home",
  action() {
    mount(Layout, {
      content: (<Main />)
    })
  }
})
```
